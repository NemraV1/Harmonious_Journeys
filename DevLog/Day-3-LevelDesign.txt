Devlog - Day 3: Polishing the Village Area and Natural Additions


Level Design Refinement - The Village:

I rolled up my sleeves and dedicated today to
fine-tuning the level design of the village area.
Every nook and cranny received careful attention
to ensure a well-crafted and engaging environment for players to explore.


Road Texture Enhancement:

To enhance the realism of the village,
I gave the roads a makeover with detailed textures.
The result is a more immersive experience as players
traverse the village's pathways.


Greening the Scene - Vegetation:

Nature came knocking as I introduced lush vegetation
to the village surroundings.
Trees, bushes, and plants were strategically placed to create
a harmonious blend between the built environment and the natural world.


A Picturesque Water Feature - The Lake and Waterfall:

Today's highlight was the creation of a serene lake
complete with a cascading waterfall.
This picturesque water feature adds a touch of tranquility to the village,
providing a peaceful spot for players to unwind.


Molding the Landscape - Terraforming:

Terraforming took center stage as I sculpted the land
to create subtle elevation changes and contours.
This adds depth and realism to the area, making it feel more natural and engaging.


And with that, Day 3 draws to a close.
The village is evolving beautifully, and the introduction
of natural elements has breathed new life into the game.
