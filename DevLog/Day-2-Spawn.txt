Devlog - Day 2: Village Construction and Player Character Setup


Main Spawn Area - The Village:

Today was all about crafting the central hub of the game,
the main spawn area or village.
With meticulous planning, I began bringing the village to life,
setting the stage for an immersive player experience.


Player Character - First-Person View:

In this one-person endeavor,
I focused on implementing the player character's first-person perspective.
This perspective choice aims to create an intimate connection
between the player and the game world,
enhancing the overall sense of immersion and exploration.


Laying Down Roads and Pathways:

The village started to take shape as I designed
and laid down the primary road networks and pathways.
These vital elements ensure smooth navigation throughout the village,
guiding players through its various captivating corners.


The Majestic Fountain:

The highlight of the day was undoubtedly the creation of a magnificent fountain,
which now graces the heart of the village.
The fountain's textures were meticulously crafted
to ensure a visually appealing centerpiece.


Infusing Serenity with Flowing Water:

With a touch of coding wizardry,
I added flowing water to the fountain,
transforming it into a tranquil oasis within the village.
The sight and sound of the water add depth to the environment and contribute
to the immersive ambiance.
